These images share the common SLES base, and none of them ship with a specific language or an application stack. All images feature the RPM database (even if the specific image does not include the RPM package manager) that can be used to verify the provenance of every file in the image. Each image includes the SLES certificate bundle, which allows the deployed applications to use the system\u0026rsquo;s certificates to verify TLS connections.\nQuick overview The table below provides a quick overview of the differences between BCI-Base, BCI-Minimal, BCI-Micro, and BCI-BusyBox.\nBCI-Base and BCI-Init: When you need flexibility This SLE BCI comes with the Zypper package manager and a free SLE-BCI repository. This allows you to install software available in the repository and customize the image during the build. The downside is the size of the image. It is the largest of the general-purpose SLE BCIs, so it is not always the best choice for a deployment image.\nA variant of BCI-Base called BCI-Init comes with systemd preinstalled. The BCI-Init container image can be useful in scenarios requiring systemd for managing services in a single container.\nBCI-Minimal: When you do not need Zypper This is a stripped-down version of the BCI-Base image. BCI-Minimal comes without Zypper, but it does have the RPM package manager installed. This significantly reduces the size of the image. However, while RPM can install and remove packages, it lacks support for repositories and automated dependency resolution. The BCI-Minimal image is therefore intended for creating deployment containers, and then installing the desired RPM packages inside the containers. Although you can install the required dependencies, you need to download and resolve them manually. However, this approach is not recommended as it is prone to errors.\nBCI-Micro: When you need to deploy static binaries This image is similar to BCI-Minimal but without the RPM package manager. The primary use case for the image is deploying static binaries produced externally or during multi-stage builds. As there is no straightforward way to install additional dependencies inside the container image, we recommend deploying a project using the BCI-Minimal image only when the final build artifact bundles all dependencies and has no external runtime requirements (like Python or Ruby).\nBCI-BusyBox: When you need the smallest and GPLv3-free image Similar to BCI-Micro, the BCI-BusyBox image comes with the most basic tools only. However, these tools are provided by the BusyBox project. This has the benefit of further size reduction. Furthermore, the image contains no GPLv3 licensed software. When using the image, keep in mind that there are certain differences between the BusyBox tools and the GNU Coreutils. So scripts written for a system that uses GNU Coreutils may require modification to work with BusyBox.\nApproximate sizes For your reference, the list below provides an approximate size of each SLE BCI. Keep in mind that the provided numbers are rough estimations.\nBCI-Base ~94 MB\nBCI-Minimal ~42 MB\nBCI-Micro ~26 MB\nBCI-BusyBox ~14 MB\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/categories/","title":"Categories","parent":"Introduction to SLE Base Container Images","content":""},{"id":2,"href":"/documentation/","title":"Documentations","parent":"Introduction to SLE Base Container Images","content":""},{"id":3,"href":"/documentation/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","parent":"Documentations","content":" What is SLE BCI?

The plugin will automatically reuse your host\u0026rsquo;s SUSE Linux Enterprise Server subscription (if present) and register the running container automatically. Thereby you gain access to the full SUSE Linux Enterprise repositories, including additional modules and previous package versions which are not part of the free SLE_BCI repository.\nHow to use container-suseconnect If you are running a registered SLES system with docker, then there is nothing that you need to do for container-suseconnect to pick up your subscription.\nOn openSUSE systems with docker, you will have to copy the files /etc/SUSEConnect and /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials from a registered SLES machine to your local machine (/etc/SUSEConnect is only required if you are using RMT for managing your registration credentials; In most cases it is not required). container-suseconnect will then automatically pick up your subscription as well.\nHow to use container-suseconnect on non-SLE hosts or with podman and buildah or with nerdctl First, you need to have access to a registered SLES system. This can be a physical machine, a virtual machine or the bci-base container into which you install SUSEConnect and register the machine. Unless you are using RMT to manage your subscription codes, you only have to copy /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials to your development machine, otherwise copy /etc/SUSEConnect as well. For example you can use the following one liner to obtain SCCcredentials (it will be shown as the last two lines of the output):\nDocker docker run --rm registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:latest bash -c \\ \u0026#34;zypper -n in SUSEConnect; SUSEConnect --regcode $YOUR_REG_CODE_HERE; \\ cat /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials\u0026#34; Podman podman run --rm registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:latest bash -c \\ \u0026#34;zypper -n in SUSEConnect; SUSEConnect --regcode $YOUR_REG_CODE_HERE; \\ cat /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials\u0026#34; nerdctl nerdctl run --rm registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:latest bash -c \\ \u0026#34;zypper -n in SUSEConnect; SUSEConnect --regcode $YOUR_REG_CODE_HERE; \\ cat /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials\u0026#34; If you are directly running a container based on a BCI, then you have to mount SCCcredentials (and optionally /etc/SUSEConnect as well) in the correct place. In the following example we put SCCcredentials into the current working directory:\nDocker docker run -v /path/to/SCCcredentials:/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials \\ -it --pull=always registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest Podman podman run -v /path/to/SCCcredentials:/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials \\ -it --pull=always registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest nerdctl nerdctl run -v /path/to/SCCcredentials:/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials \\ -it --pull=always registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest It is highly recommended not to copy the SCCcredentials and SUSEConnect files into your container image, as these files can easily end up in your final image or one of its intermediate layers unless exceptional care is taken. Instead, we recommend to rely on secrets, as these are only available to a single layer and are not part of the built image. All you need is a copy of SCCcredentials and (optionally SUSEConnect) somewhere on your file system and to modify the RUN instructions which will invoke zypper as follows:\nFROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SUSEConnect \\ --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials \\ zypper -n in fluxbox Docker and buildah both support mounting secrets via the --secret flag as follows: Docker docker build --secret=id=SCCcredentials,src=/path/to/SCCcredentials \\ --secret=id=SUSEConnect,src=/path/to/SUSEConnect . Podman buildah bud --layers --secret=id=SCCcredentials,src=/path/to/SCCcredentials \\ --secret=id=SUSEConnect,src=/path/to/SUSEConnect . Adding additional modules into the container or container Image container-suseconnect allows you to automatically add SLE Modules into a container or container image. Which modules are added is controlled via the environment variable ADDITIONAL_MODULES. It should be set to a comma separated list of the full module names. In a Dockerfile, this can be achieved using the ENV directive as follows:\nFROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest ENV ADDITIONAL_MODULES sle-module-desktop-applications,sle-module-development-tools RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials zypper -n in fluxbox \u0026amp;\u0026amp; zypper -n clean "},{"id":6,"href":"/","title":"Introduction to SLE Base Container Images","parent":"","content":"SLE Base Container Image (SLE BCI) are minimal SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15-based images that you can use to develop, deploy, and share applications. There are two types of SLE BCI:\nGeneral-purpose SLE BCI can be used for building custom container images and for deploying applications. Language stack SLE BCI provide minimal environments for developing and deploying applications in specific programming languages. In addition to that, we will provide Application Container Images based on SLE BCI featuring popular containerized applications like Nginx, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and RMT.\nHighlights SLE BCI are fully compatible with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, but they do not require a subscription to run and distribute them.\nSLE BCI automatically run in FIPS-compatible mode when the host operating system is running in FIPS mode.\nEach SLE BCI includes the RPM database, which makes it possible to audit the contents of the container image. You can use the RPM database to determine the specific version of the RPM package any given file belongs to. This allows you to ensure that a container image is not susceptible to known and already fixed vulnerabilities.\nAll SLE BCI (except for those without zypper) come with the container-suseconnect service. This gives containers that run on a registered SLES host access to the full SLES repositories. container-suseconnect is invoked automatically when you run zypper for the first time, and the service adds the correct SLES repositories into the running container. On an unregistered SLES host or on a non-SLES host, the service does nothing.\nGeneral-purpose SLE BCI There are four general purpose SLE BCI, and each container image comes with a minimum set of packages to keep its size low. You can use a general purpose SLE BCI either as a starting point for building custom container images, or as a platform for deploying specific software. For more information about general purpose SLE BCI, see here.\nLanguage stack SLE BCI Language stack SLE BCI are built on top of the BCI-Base general-purpose SLE BCI. Each container image comes with the zypper stack and the free SLE_BCI repository. Additionally, each image includes most common tools for building and deploying applications in the specific language environment. This includes tools like a compiler or interpreter as well as the language specific package manager. For more information about language stack SLE BCI, see here.\nImportant note on status and lifecycle All container images, except for bci-base, are currently classified as tech preview, and SUSE doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide official support for them. This information is visible on the web on registry.suse.com. In addition to that, it is also indicated via the com.suse.supportlevel label whether a container image still has the tech preview status. You can use the skopeo and jq utilities to check the status of the desired SLE BCI as follows:\n❯ skopeo inspect docker://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-micro:15.4 | jq \u0026#39;.Labels[\u0026#34;com.suse.supportlevel\u0026#34;]\u0026#39; \u0026#34;techpreview\u0026#34; ❯ skopeo inspect docker://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 | jq \u0026#39;.Labels[\u0026#34;com.suse.supportlevel\u0026#34;]\u0026#39; \u0026#34;l3\u0026#34; In the example above, the com.suse.supportlevel label is set to techpreview in the bci-micro container image, indicating that the image still has the tech preview status. The bci-base container image on the other hand is fully l3 supported. Unlike like the general purpose SLE BCI, the language stack SLE BCI may not follow the lifecycle of the SLE distribution: they are supported as long as the respective language stack receives support. In other words, new versions of SLE BCI (indicated by the OCI tags) may be released during the lifecycle of a SLE Service Pack, while older versions may become unsupported. Refer to suse.com/lifecycle to find out whether the container in question is still under support.\nGetting started The SLE BCI are available as OCI-compatible container images directly from registry.suse.com and can be used like any other container image. For example, using one of the general purpose containers:\nDocker ❯ docker run --rm -it registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 grep \u0026#39;^NAME\u0026#39; /etc/os-release NAME=\u0026#34;SLES\u0026#34; Podman ❯ podman run --rm -it registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 grep \u0026#39;^NAME\u0026#39; /etc/os-release NAME=\u0026#34;SLES\u0026#34; nerdctl ❯ nerdctl run --rm -it registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 grep \u0026#39;^NAME\u0026#39; /etc/os-release NAME=\u0026#34;SLES\u0026#34; Alternatively, you can use SLE BCI in a Dockerfile as follows:\nFROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4 RUN zypper -n in python3 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ echo \u0026#34;Hello Green World!\u0026#34; \u0026gt; index.html ENTRYPOINT [\u0026#34;/usr/bin/python3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-m\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http.server\u0026#34;] EXPOSE 8000 You can then build container images using your favorite container runtime:\nDocker ❯ docker build .

Similar to APT in Debian and APK in Alpine Linux, Zypper offers a command-line interface for all package management tasks. Below is brief overview of commonly used container-related Zypper commands.\nInstall packages zypper --non-interactive install $PACKAGE_NAME Add a repository zypper --non-interactive addrepo $REPOSITORY_URL; zypper --non-interactive refresh Update all packages zypper --non-interactive update Remove a package zypper --non-interactive remove --clean-deps $PACKAGE_NAME the --clean-deps flag ensures that no longer required dependencies are removed as well\nClean up temporary files zypper clean For more information on using Zypper, refer to the zypper documentation.\nAll the described commands use the --non-interactive flag to skip confirmations, since you cannot approve these manually during container builds. Keep in mind that you must use the flag with any command that modifies the system. Also note that --non-interactive is not a \u0026ldquo;yes to all\u0026rdquo; flag. Instead, --non-interactive confirms what is considered to be the intention of the user. For example, an installation command with the --non-interactive option fails if it needs to import new repository signing keys, as that is something that the user should verify themselves.\nCommon patterns Here are a few examples that can give you an idea how to accomplish certain tasks in SLE BCI compared to Debian.\nRemove orphaned packages Debian: apt-get autoremove -y\nSLE BCI: Not required as long as you remove installed packages using the zypper --non-interactive remove --clean-deps $PACKAGE_NAME\nObtain container\u0026rsquo;s architecture Debian: dpkgArch=\u0026quot;$(dpkg --print-architecture | awk -F- '{ print $NF }')\u0026quot;\nSLE BCI: arch=\u0026quot;$(uname -p|sed 's/x86_64/amd64/')\u0026quot;\nInstall packages required for compilation Debian: apt-get install -y build-essential\nSLE BCI: zypper -n in gcc gcc-c++ make\nVerify GnuPG signatures Debian: gpg --batch --verify $SIGNATURE_URL $FILE_TO_VERIFY\nSLE BCI: zypper -n in dirmngr; gpg --batch --verify $SIGNATURE_URL $FILE_TO_VERIFY; zypper -n remove --clean-deps dirmngr; zypper -n clean\nPackage naming conventions SUSE Linux Enterprise package naming conventions differ from Debian, Ubuntu, and Alpine, and they are closer to those of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The main difference is that development packages of libraries (that is, packages containing headers and build description files) are named $PACKAGE-devel in SUSE Linux Enterprise, as opposed to $PACKAGE-dev as they are in Debian and Ubuntu. When in doubt, search for the package directly using the following command:\nDocker docker run --rm registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:$OS_VERSION zypper search $PACKAGE_NAME Podman podman run --rm registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:$OS_VERSION zypper search $PACKAGE_NAME nerdctl nerdctl run --rm registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:$OS_VERSION zypper search $PACKAGE_NAME (replace OS_VERSION with the appropriate service version number, for example: 15.3 or 15.4).\nAdding GPG signing keys Adding external repositories to a container or container image normally requires importing the GPG key used for signing the packages. This can be done with the rpm --import $KEY_URL command. This adds the key to the RPM database, and all packages from the repository can be installed afterwards.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/guides/verify-with-cosign/","title":"Verify SUSE SLE Base Container Images With Cosign","parent":"Guides","content":"SUSE has SLE Base Container Images (BCI) that are great to use in workflows and as a based under your applications.

Happy to see these container images provide a great foundation and security.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/documentation/why-sle-bci/","title":"Why SLE Base Container Images","parent":"Documentations","content":"SLE BCIs offer a platform for creating SLE-based custom container images and containerized applications that can be distributed freely. SLE BCIs feature the same predictable enterprise lifecycle as SLES. The SLE_BCI 15 SP3 and SP4 repository (which is a subset of the SLE repository) gives SLE BCIs access to 4,000 packages available for the AMD64/Intel 64, AArch64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures. The packages in the repository have undergone quality assurance and security audits by SUSE. The container images are FIPS-compliant when running on a host in FIPS mode. In addition to that, SUSE can provide official support for SLE BCIs through SUSE subscription plans.\nSecurity Each package in the SLE_BCI repository undergoes security audits, and SLE BCIs benefit from the same mechanism of dealing with CVEs as SLES. All discovered and fixed vulnerabilities are announced via e-mail, the dedicated CVE pages, and as OVAL and CVRF data. To ensure a secure supply chain, all container images are signed with Notary v1, Podman\u0026rsquo;s GPG signatures, and Sigstore Cosign.\nStability Since SLE BCIs are based on SLE, they feature the same level of stability and quality assurance as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Similar to SLES, SLE BCIs receive maintenance updates that provide bug fixes, improvements, and security patches.\nTooling and integration SLE BCIs are designed to provide drop-in replacements for popular container images available on hub.docker.com. You can use the general-purpose SLE BCIs and the tools they put at your disposal to create custom container images, while the language stack SLE BCIs provide a foundation and the required tooling for building containerized applications.\nRedistribution BCIs are covered by a permissive EULA that allows you to redistribute custom container images based on a BCI.\n"}]
